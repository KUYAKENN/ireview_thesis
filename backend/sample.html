    <h1><b>Prepositions: A Comprehensive Review</b></h1>

    <p>A <span class="blue-highlight">preposition</span> is a word or group of words that shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and another word in the sentence.  They often indicate location, time, or direction.</p>

    <p>Examples:  <span class="blue-highlight">in, on, at, above, below, beside, between, among, to, from, with, by, for, about, of, etc.</span></p>

    <h2><b>Exercises</b></h2>

    <h3><b>Exercise 1: Fill in the Blanks</b></h3>
    <p>Student: Excuse me, when are your office hours?</p>
    <p>Instructor: I am available to meet you Thursday <b>at</b> 13:30 and 15:30.</p>
    <p>Student: I have class that time. Can we meet <b>at</b> lunch?</p>
    <p>Instructor: Is it urgent?</p>
    <p>Student: Yes, I have some questions to ask you <b>about</b> the mid-term exam.</p>
    <p>Instructor: You can come to my office <b>at</b> 11:00. Does that work <b>for</b> you?</p>
    <p>Student: Yes, thank you. Can you remind me where your office is?</p>
    <p>Instructor: My office is <b>on</b> the third floor, room A321 <b>in</b> the David Turpin Building.</p>
    <p>Student: Thank you very much! See you then.</p>


    <h3><b>Exercise 2: Add Prepositions</b></h3>
    <p>Student: Hi Pr. Smith. I am Amanda Liu <b>from</b> your Introduction to Postmodernist Literature Class 204. I missed class <b>for</b> the past two weeks. I had a family emergency that I needed to attend <b>to</b>. I wonder if you might be able to give me notes <b>on</b> the lectures that I missed.</p>
    <p>Instructor: I am sorry to hear that you had a family emergency <b>to</b> deal <b>with</b>. Unfortunately, I cannot give you my notes <b>for</b> fairness <b>to</b> other students. Do you have any friends who could share their notes <b>with</b> you?</p>
    <p>Student: Yes, but they are a total mess. What did you discuss <b>in</b> class <b>during</b> my absence?</p>
    <p>Instructor: <b>Over</b> the last two weeks, we looked <b>at</b> narrative techniques such as fragmentation and temporal distortion, <b>with</b> a specific emphasis <b>on</b> the work of David Foster Wallace. You will find information <b>about</b> these techniques <b>in</b> the textbook <b>on</b> page 208 and page 252.</p>
    <p>Student: Thank you, I will review these pages.</p>


    <h3><b>Exercise 3: Correct the Mistakes</b></h3>
    <p>After reading excerpts of Wallace's Infinite Jest, there was something that seemed odd <b>to</b> me. In my notes, I wrote that the heavy use of endnotes is meant to disrupt the linear narrative. Given Wallace’s perception <b>of</b> reality as contingent, I can understand the latter interpretation. I’m having difficulty understanding how the conclusion can be said to be open-ended, though. I understand that it has something to do <b>with</b> the story eschewing chronological plot development and straightforward resolution, which support a wide range of readings, but the reliance <b>on</b> endnotes does seem to maintain some sense of narrative cohesion. I’ve talked to a few others in class, and none of them have been able to provide me <b>with</b> much insight. Would you be able to explain this <b>to</b> me? If you do not have time to do so via email, would you be willing to discuss it <b>at</b> the beginning of next class?</p>
